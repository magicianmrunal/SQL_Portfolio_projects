****SQL Project: World Layoffs**** (2020â€“2023)

The project focuses on understanding trends in layoffs through rigorous data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**Project Overview This project is divided into two key parts:**

**Data Cleaning** - Ensuring the dataset is clean and reliable by performing the following steps:

1. Remove Duplicates: Eliminated duplicate records to maintain data accuracy.
2. Standardize the Data: Applied consistent formatting across columns to improve clarity.
3. Handle Null and Blank Values: Replaced or removed null and blank entries to ensure data integrity.
4. Remove Unnecessary Columns and Rows: Filtered out irrelevant information to focus on key insights.

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** - Conducted in-depth analyses to uncover patterns and insights regarding global layoffs. This includes identifying trends over time, sector-wise layoffs, and other key metrics.

**Conclusion**
The EDA provided several key insights into global layoff patterns:

1. Time Trends: Layoffs peaked in specific years and months, driven by economic and sectoral challenges.
2. Industries: Consumer and retail sectors were hit hardest.
3. Geographies: The U.S. led in layoffs, followed by India and the Netherlands.
4. Companies: Certain companies had consistently high layoffs, while others experienced isolated spikes.
