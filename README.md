SQL Project: World Layoffs (2020â€“2023)
The project focuses on understanding trends in layoffs through rigorous data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

**Project Overview This project is divided into two key parts:**

1 Data Cleaning Ensuring the dataset is clean and reliable by performing the following steps:

**Remove Duplicates: Eliminated duplicate records to maintain data accuracy.
**Standardize the Data: Applied consistent formatting across columns to improve clarity.
**Handle Null and Blank Values: Replaced or removed null and blank entries to ensure data integrity.
**Remove Unnecessary Columns and Rows: Filtered out irrelevant information to focus on key insights.

2 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Conducted in-depth analyses to uncover patterns and insights regarding global layoffs. This includes identifying trends over time, sector-wise layoffs, and other key metrics.

**Conclusion**
The EDA provided several key insights into global layoff patterns:

**Time Trends**: Layoffs peaked in specific years and months, driven by economic and sectoral challenges.
**Industries**: Consumer and retail sectors were hit hardest.
**Geographies**: The U.S. led in layoffs, followed by India and the Netherlands.
